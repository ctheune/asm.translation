0.1.8 (2010-08-06)
------------------

- Fixed issue with language selector: if a translation exists but doesn't have
  identical parameters then the translation would be reported missing and a
  new translation would be created instead of relying on the existing one.
  This led to confusion when used together with the draft/public workflow.
